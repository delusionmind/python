2 - Demonstrate the decision making and Iterative statements in Python   
         
    i) “if” and its variants        ii) while and for loops.


num = 10

if num > 0:
    print("Number is positive")
elif num == 0:
    print("Number is zero")
else:
    print("Number is negative")


Iterative Statements with for loop:


fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)


Iterative Statements with while loop:

count = 0
while count < 5:
    print("Count:", count)
    count += 1
